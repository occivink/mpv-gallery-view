# this option lets you define the thumbnail size dynamically depending on the window size
# if it is defined, the two previous options are ignored
# its syntax is the following
# PIXELS_1,WIDTH_1,HEIGHT_1;PIXELS_2,WIDTH_2,HEIGHT_2;...
# such that if the window is smaller than PIXELS_1 the thumbnails are WIDTH_1 x HEIGHT_1
# otherwise if the window is smaller than PIXELS_2 the thumbnails are WIDTH_2 x HEIGHT_2
# ...and so on
# the more presets (PIXELS,WIDTH,HEIGHT triple) you have, the more thumbnails will be generated
# the value of PIXELS in the last preset should be bigger than your display's resolution. 1e20 can be used for that purpose
# examples:
# 3 presets for 1080p
