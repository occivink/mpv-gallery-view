# thumbnail directory in which to create and look for thumbnails
# on Unix-like platforms:
#thumbs_dir=~/.cache/thumbnails/mpv-gallery
# on Windows:
#thumbs_dir=%APPDATA%\mpv\gallery-thumbs-dir
# note: not all env vars get expanded, only '~', 'APPDATA' and ':dir%mpvconf%' (':dir%mpvconf' is the mpv config directory) do

# create thumbs_dir if it doesn't exist
# mkdir_thumbs=yes

# use mpv instead of ffmpeg for thumbnail generation
# slightly slower and does not support transparency, but does not require additional ffmpeg/ffprobe executables
# yes on Windows, no on other plateforms
#generate_thumbnails_with_mpv=no

# all options below are platform-independent

# fine-grained controls for the geometry of the gallery
# each option can have a fixed value, or dynamic by using the following variables:
# ww, wh: mpv window width, mpv window height (always available)
# gx, gy: gallery horizontal position, gallery vertical position
# gw, gh: gallery width, gallery height
# sw, sh: minimum spacing width, minimum spacing height
# tw, th: thumbnail width, thumbnail height
# these strings are interpreted using the lua equivalent of "eval" so math functions and logical conditions can be used
# if an option references variables, they will be computed in the appropriate order
# (for example, if gallery_width == 5 * thumbnail_width, thumbnail_size will be computed before gallery_size)
# in case of cyclical dependencies, the script will abort
# example
# -------
# make the gallery centered
gallery_position={ (ww - gw) / 2, (wh - gh) / 2 }
# make the gallery's size 9/10 the size of the window
gallery_size={ 9 * ww / 10, 9 * wh / 10 }
# with at least 15 pixels of spacing between each thumbnail
min_spacing={ 15, 15 }
# and two thumbnail size presets for Windows smaller/bigger than 1366 x 768
thumbnail_size=(ww * wh <= 1366 * 768) and {192, 108} or {288, 162}
# it is recommended to use discrete increments for thumbnail_size since a new thumbnail needs to be generated for each size

# limit the number of thumbnails visible, even if more could be shown
