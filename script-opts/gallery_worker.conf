# accepts a |-separated list of URL patterns which gallery.lua should thumbnail using youtube-dl.
# The patterns are matched after the http(s):// part of the URL.
#^ matches the beginning of the URL, $ matches its end, and you should use % before any of the characters ^$()%|,.[]*+-? to match that character.
#
#Examples
#  will exclude any URL that starts with http://youtube.com or https://youtube.com:
#     ytdl_exclude=^youtube%.com
#  will exclude any URL that ends with .mkv or .mp4:
#     ytdl_exclude=%.mkv$|%.mp4$
#  See more lua patterns here: https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.4.1
